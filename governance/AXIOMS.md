# BINARY SEMANTIC GOVERNANCE AXIOMS

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** IMMUTABLE  
**Hash:** SHA-256  

---

## AXIOM KERNEL

These axioms are **foundational and immutable**. They cannot be overridden by semantic memory, historical precedent, or governance decisions.

### A0: Binary Finality
```
∀ x ∈ Propositions: decide(x) ∈ {ACCEPT, REJECT}
```
Every completed governance evaluation terminates as exactly ACCEPT (1) or REJECT (0).

**Proof Obligation:** T1 (Binary decision exclusivity)

---

### A1: Evidence Before Decision
```
∀ x: requires_evidence(x) ⟹ ¬ACCEPT(x) ∨ evidence_satisfied(x)
```
No semantic assertion requiring evidence may become accepted governance state without evidence satisfying its declared policy.

**Enforcement:** Pre-decision evidence validation

---

### A2: Provenance Required
```
∀ x: ACCEPT(x) ⟹ ∃ p: provenance(x, p) ∧ valid(p)
```
Every accepted state MUST identify its derivation and provenance.

**Proof Obligation:** T6 (Provenance validity)

---

### A3: No Silent Mutation
```
∀ t₁ < t₂: M(t₁) ⊆ M(t₂)
```
Previously committed semantic memory MUST NOT be silently modified.

**Proof Obligation:** T2 (Semantic-memory monotonicity)

---

### A4: Contradiction Visibility
```
∀ x, y: contradicts(x, y) ⟹ visible(x) ∧ visible(y) ∨ resolved(x, y)
```
Contradictory propositions MUST remain visible until formally resolved.

**Enforcement:** Contradiction engine

---

### A5: Axiom Priority
```
∀ x, a: violates(x, a) ⟹ REJECT(x)
```
Semantic memory cannot override an axiom merely because a previous decision or repeated observation contradicts that axiom.

**Invariant:** I4 (Axiom supremacy)

---

### A6: Memory Non-Authority
```
frequency(x, M) ⇏ truth(x)
```
Historical frequency does not imply truth.

**Proof Obligation:** T8 (Semantic recall independence)

---

### A7: Deterministic Replay
```
∀ x, M, A, I, E: decide(x, M, A, I, E) = decide(x, M, A, I, E)
```
Identical canonical inputs, axiom version, invariant version and evidence state MUST reproduce the same decision.

**Proof Obligation:** T3 (Deterministic replay)

---

### A8: Explicit Revision
```
∀ x, y: supersedes(y, x) ⟹ accessible(x) ∧ accessible(y)
```
A superseded proposition remains historically addressable.

**Proof Obligation:** T7 (Supersession preservation)

---

### A9: Proof Before Seal
```
∀ x: VERIFIED(x) ⟹ discharged(proof_obligations(x))
```
No decision may receive VERIFIED status unless all required proof obligations have been discharged.

**Enforcement:** Zero-sorry policy

---

### A10: Memory Traceability
```
∀ m ∈ M: ∃ s: source(m, s) ∧ valid(s)
```
Every recalled semantic-memory item MUST identify its source record.

**Enforcement:** Provenance chain

---

### A11: No Circular Evidence
```
∀ x, e: evidence(x, e) ⟹ ¬depends_on(e, x)
```
A decision cannot establish its own premises merely by referencing itself or descendants derived exclusively from itself.

**Proof Obligation:** Acyclicity check

---

### A12: Temporal Integrity
```
∀ m, t: timestamp(m) = t ⟹ ¬∃ e: evidence_at(e, t') ∧ t' > t ∧ supports(e, m)
```
Later semantic memory MUST NOT be represented as evidence that it existed at an earlier time.

**Enforcement:** Timestamp validation

---

### A13: Human Governance Boundary
```
∀ x: requires_human_auth(x) ⟹ ¬ACCEPT(x) ∨ human_authorized(x)
```
Where policy requires human authorization, machine derivation may recommend or verify but MUST NOT fabricate authorization.

**Enforcement:** Authorization validation

---

## AXIOM VERSION

```
AXIOM_VERSION: 1.0.0
AXIOM_COUNT: 13
AXIOM_HASH: <computed from canonical representation>
IMMUTABLE: TRUE
```

---

## USAGE

These axioms are referenced in every governance decision:

```
decide(x) = ACCEPT
  iff
  A0(x) ∧ A1(x) ∧ A2(x) ∧ A3(x) ∧ A4(x) ∧ A5(x) ∧
  A6(x) ∧ A7(x) ∧ A8(x) ∧ A9(x) ∧ A10(x) ∧ A11(x) ∧ A12(x) ∧ A13(x)
```

Any violation of any axiom results in **REJECT**.

---

## MODIFICATION POLICY

Axioms are **IMMUTABLE** within a version. To modify axioms:

1. Create new axiom version (e.g., 2.0.0)
2. Prove backward compatibility or migration path
3. Update all dependent systems
4. Maintain historical axiom versions for replay
